  KJ is from New Jersey and is currently a sophmore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Economics and Urban Studies. He is currenlty in South Africa studying web development, and he is taught by none other than the dynamic duo of Aziz Ansari and Rafi Khan.Although this is his first time coding, KJ has enjoyed learning how to code because he gets to do stuff. Really cool stuff. Really really cool stuff. Stuff so cool that it makes him want to put a sweater on everytime he starts to code. Stuff like making a personal coder's selfie.
